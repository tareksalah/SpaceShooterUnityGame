# SpaceShooterUnityGame

The implementation files of the Unity Tutorial game (Space Shooter)

This was the first game tutorial of Unity on this link:
https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial

In this project are my implementation files + the original files of the tutorial.

Also the build for PC is in the files in two levels:
- Level1: Without Enemy Ships
- Level2: With Enemy Ships


In future: 
    - I'll get back to this to make it compatable to run on a touch screen.
    - Also I intend to transform it into VR mode.
